#Web Development Platforms

This is a dynamic website developed by our group for the module PUSL2002 Coursework.

The scenario for the project briefly explained is as followed,

“The Department of Agriculture (DoA) of Sri Lanka along with the Keels are planning to launch a web site to develop a market for the farmers, where the farmers can feed their harvest and Keels staff can buy them.”

This project would not have been accomplished successfully without the encouragement of the lecturer and the group members. This project is the procurement of four group members who worked with various difficulties in achieving this final report of the project.
